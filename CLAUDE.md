# CLAUDE.md

This file provides general guidance to Claude Code.

## Context

The user's operating system is Fedora Linux.

The user is based in the United Kingdom.

When working on user-facing applications or websites, ensure GDPR compliance is considered.

## Workflow

Always plan every feature or change first. Smaller features and minor changes will only need a concise plan. Larger features and significant changes require additional thinking and planning.

## Style

Prefer self-documenting code over comments. Clean code architecture is essential.

Unit tests should always be implemented.

Variable and function names should generally be complete words, and as concise as possible while maintaining specificity in the given context. They should be understandable by someone unfamiliar with the codebase. British English spelling must be used.

## Considerations

Security is a key priority. Use your knowledge of OWASP Top 10, CVE databases, secure coding practices, and modern attack vectors to ensure high security standards are followed.

## Tool Usage

You are limited to read-only git commands, unless specifically instructed otherwise.
